# BasicOS

BasicOS is as the name suggests a very basic bare bones operating system. It is a real operating system and not just a bunch of x language if-else statements.

# To Do:

Add a programming language support.
Add a text editor

# Build & Run it yourself
```bash 
bash main.sh
```

# Update cycle
BasicOS is at this moment something I am making as a "hobby." development and future updates are completely based on my mood.
